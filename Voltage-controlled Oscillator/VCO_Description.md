# Description

Current Starved Voltage Controlled Ring Oscillator
- Current starved VCO that consist of the 5 number of inverter stages (M1-M10) connected in ring oscillator configuration,current source (M11-M20) and bias stage (M25-M28 & R2).
- The current sources limit the current available to the inverter stage which controls the delay of an inverter.
- A series combination of R1 ~ 40K and a wide NMOS M28 with W/L ~ 100 is used which keeps Vgs always approximately Vth leads to bias current linearly related to Vctrl.
- The current in M26 is mirrored M25 and M27 to control the current used in ring osscillator's inverter stages.â€‹

We calculate the Kvco and get the result Kvco = 125 Mhz/V.

The Vctrl range for saturation current is from about 0.8 to 2.5V. In this range the output frequency is linear with Vctrl.

At Vctrl = 1.65V, output:
+ frequency = 98.04 MHz
+ Rise time = 0.49 s
+ Fall time = 0,36 s
+ Duty cycle = 47.06%
